# A_Better_World - DINGO GameJam26

## Game Theme

This year's theme is **A BETTER WORLD**

## Game Idea

This years game is a clicker progressive game. The idea is to have the player click their way into cleaning planet earth. It is a lot of clicking, so to make it easier, the player can buy upgrades like robots to help them click faster and stronger. There are 3 phases for the planet: a dirty phase, a neutral phase (nothing yet but at least no trash), a better world phase (green trees and a happy planet).
